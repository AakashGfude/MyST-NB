# Sphinx Jupyter Notebook

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx-jupyter-notebook/badge/?version=latest)](https://sphinx-jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A collection of tools for working with Jupyter Notebooks in Sphinx.

The primary tool this package provides is a Sphinx parser for `ipynb` files.
This allows you to directly convert Jupyter Notebooks into Sphinx documents.
It relies heavily on the [`MyST` parser](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/myst_parser).
