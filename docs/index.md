# Sphinx Notebook

A collection of tools for working with Jupyter Notebooks in Sphinx.

The primary tool this package provides is a Sphinx parser for `ipynb` files.
This allows you to directly convert Jupyter Notebooks into Sphinx documents.
It relies heavily on the [`MyST` parser](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/myst_parser).
